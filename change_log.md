## Change Log
0.0.4
  - better logic for selecting parts involved in transfer (solves some cases of pump not working on more complex craft).
  - Pump Fuel button is only shown on context menu for docking ports which are docked.

0.0.3
- updated to KSP 1.3.1
- bug fixes
- tweaks to rate of transfer and heating
- added setting to control heating rate
- added setting to control which resources are ignored
- added setting to enable certain resources to be transfered in the opposite direction

0.0.2
- prevent transfer of non-transferable resources ie solid rocket fuel.
- prevent transferring fuel from tanks which have been locked.
- much lower power usage.
- transfer speed is slightly reduced.
- different heating system; pump is less likely to overheat but will become less efficient as the temperature goes up. So radiators can be used to increase efficiency.
