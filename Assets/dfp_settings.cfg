  RESOPTS
  //Resource Options - all resources are transfered by the docking fuel pump except those which are NOFLOW (ie solid fuel)
  //resources defined here can be set to be ignored (ignore) or set to transfer in the opposite direction (reverse)
  //reverse transfer can be useful for waste products, ie when using TAC-LF; 
  //ie fuel, food, oxygen and water are tranfered in one direction while waste resources are transfered in the other direction.
